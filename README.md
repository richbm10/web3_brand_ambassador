Problem:
There is a lack of transparency in conversions and attribution between multiple marketing parties, leading to mistrust and ineffective tracking of results across various marketing channels.

Solution:
Utilize the security and decentralization of the Optimism L2 Blockchain to transparently record and audit attributions and conversions of Brand Ambassadors in Affiliate Marketing campaigns. This creates a transparent network accessible to any party, enhancing trust and tracking efficiency.

Project Overview:
Mafi is a Web3 Affiliate Marketing solution that mirrors the goals of traditional web2 affiliate marketing but leverages the Optimism blockchain for transparent conversion tracking. Our solution involves three key roles: Client Brand Manager, Brand Ambassador, and Customer.

Platform Implementation:

1. Client Brand Manager:
  - Create Affiliate Marketing campaigns.
  - Include Brand Ambassadors from our platformâ€™s network.
  - Validate the MVP using account abstraction by creating a web3 wallet to minimize barriers to entry.
2. Brand Ambassador:
  - Access the Mafi platform to send affiliate requests or respond to client requests.
  - Authenticate by connecting their web3 wallet to our platform.
3. Campaign Process:
  - Once a campaign reaches the minimum number of affiliates, it is submitted to the blockchain.
  - We use an ERC1155 NFT collection and the MafiBrandAmbassador contract to track conversions and affiliates.
  - Each Brand Ambassador receives a unique deep link to share across marketing channels, attributing sales to their efforts.
4. Customer Interaction:
  - Customers click on the link, download the Mafi mobile app, authenticate, and purchase the NFT.
  - The purchase involves the MafiBrandAmbassador contract, splitting the payment: 5% commission to the Brand Ambassador, the remainder to Mafi.

Benefits:

Public, decentralized records of conversions and attributions.
A global ranking system for Brand Ambassadors based on performance.

# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Lock.ts
```
